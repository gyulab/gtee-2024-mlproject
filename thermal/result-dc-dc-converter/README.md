- original-iv: Original HV Model on January which had W=3 and higher Id value compared to current measured data
- thermal-iv: Thermal HV Model reflecting experiment data, which has W=0.6(E-mode)/0.3(D-mode) and lower Id value
- original-simulation: DC-DC Simulation result of the original HV model
- thermal-w-0.6-0.3: DC-DC Simulation result with the actual magnitude-fitted model
- thermal-w-3: DC-DC Simulation result with W=3 as same as original HV-IWO (Seems more plausible)
- simulation-setup: Simulation setup figure (ADE Explorer)
- HV_DC_DC_Conv_IEDM_12to6V_thermal.zip: Cadence file list for simulation and schematic netlist
